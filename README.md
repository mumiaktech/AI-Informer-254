### How to Create Your Own Free Chatbot on Poe (No Code)

#### 1. **Sign Up on Poe.com**

Head over to [https://poe.com](https://poe.com) and create a free account. It’s quick and doesn’t require a ChatGPT Plus subscription.

#### 2. **Start a New Bot (Prompt Bot)**

Once you're signed in, click your profile and select **"Create a Bot"**. Choose the **Prompt Bot** option to build a custom chatbot using instructions.

#### 3. **Give Your Bot a Unique Name**

Pick a name that clearly reflects your chatbot’s theme or personality. For example: *AI Trends Guide*, *Tech Chat Mentor*, or *Ask Me AI*.

#### 4. **Write a Clear Description**

Help users understand what your chatbot does by writing a short, friendly description. This appears on the bot’s profile and sets expectations.

#### 5. **Select a Free Base Model**

For free usage, choose **GPT-3.5-Turbo** (sometimes labeled as **ChatGPT** or **Sage**, depending on Poe's interface). This keeps everything accessible without requiring Poe Pro.

#### 6. **Craft a Powerful Prompt**

Write a thoughtful prompt that defines your chatbot’s behavior and tone. Include:

* What it knows (e.g., AI trends, tools, concepts)
* How it should talk (e.g., friendly, clear, helpful)
* Any limitations (e.g., no internet access, not a coding bot)

> *Tip: See my full example prompt in the post above.*

#### 7. **Add a Knowledge Base (Optional)**

If the platform supports it, upload files or documents to expand your bot’s knowledge. This makes answers more detailed and personalized.

#### 8. **Set a Greeting Message**

Customize the first thing users see when they interact with your bot. A warm, clear greeting improves engagement right away.

#### 9. **Explore Advanced Settings**

Fine-tune how your bot behaves — such as response style, visibility, or default behavior — by adjusting the advanced options.

#### 10. **Create a Visual Identity**

Design or generate an avatar or banner image for your chatbot. A friendly, visually engaging image can boost clicks and user trust.

#### 11. **Publish and Share**

Once you're happy with the setup, publish your chatbot and share the link with your audience, on your blog, or via social media.
